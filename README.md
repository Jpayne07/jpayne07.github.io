## What the Project Does
This project is a homebase for the portfolio of me, Jacob Payne.

# About Highlighted Projects
There are 2 links associated with the projects section. The 1st is the demo, which has a fully functioning backend hosted on Render. 

The second is my source code, which has a packaged and tidy app that can run locally.

### Project backend
The project backend utilizes blueprints to give my routes nested folders. One for each of my apps.

## Why the project is useful
This project houses my frontend for my portfolio site and it also houses the apps I have created. 
It is hosted on Github pages and the projects are repos hosted here as well.

My backend is hosted on render and all fetches point to that.

## Who maintains and contributes
Just me!
